# Hi, I'm Allen! ðŸ‘‹ 
The goal of this project is to create a system for detecting plant diseases.


## ðŸŒ¿ Overview
This project aims to develop a Plant Disease Detection System using image processing and machine learning techniques. The system can identify and classify diseases in plants based on leaf images, providing an effective tool for early diagnosis and management in agriculture.
## ðŸ›  Features

- Disease Detection: Identifies and classifies plant diseases based on leaf images.
- Image Processing: Preprocesses images using techniques like resizing, normalization, and augmentation.
- Machine Learning Model: Trained using [CNN].
- User-Friendly Interface: A simple interface for uploading and analyzing images.
